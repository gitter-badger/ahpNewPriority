# Research Python Notebooks

These files are a some notebooks I've made to play with the new idea (or ideas) for priority calculations.

* [ResearchNewPriorityCalc.ipynb](ResearchNewPriorityCalc.ipynb) is the first notebook I created to do the initial new multiplication and check for convergence.
* [Beginnings.ipynb](Beginnings.ipynb) is a notebook with the full algorithm and few calculations.
